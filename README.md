# Philosophers42

## Description:

This repository contains an implementation of the Dining Philosophers Problem, a classic concurrency problem in computer science. The project simulates a scenario where a set number of philosophers sit around a dining table, alternating between thinking and eating while sharing a limited number of forks.

## Key Features:

Implementation of a solution to the Dining Philosophers Problem using [programming language or framework].
Representation of philosophers as concurrent processes/threads that alternate between thinking and eating.
Utilization of shared resources (forks) among adjacent philosophers, requiring synchronization and mutual exclusion.
Prevention of deadlocks and ensuring fairness in resource allocation among philosophers.
Exploration of different synchronization techniques, such as mutexes, semaphores, or other concurrency primitives.
Option to customize the number of philosophers, eating cycles, or additional constraints for experimentation.
## Purpose:

Developed as an exercise to understand and implement concurrent programming concepts, mutual exclusion, and synchronization in a multi-threaded or multi-process environment.
Demonstrates strategies to address concurrency issues, prevent deadlocks, and ensure fair access to shared resources.
Encourages exploration and experimentation with synchronization primitives and concurrent algorithms.
## Usage:

Clone the repository and compile/run the provided source code using a compatible compiler or interpreter for [programming language].
Experiment with different parameters, such as the number of philosophers, eating cycles, or synchronization techniques.
Observe the behavior of the simulation to understand how different strategies impact resource allocation and concurrency.
## Note:

This repository provides a solution specific to the Dining Philosophers Problem and may be part of a programming course or educational project.
Contributions, enhancements, or alternative synchronization strategies are welcomed for further exploration and improvement.
